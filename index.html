      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <ul class = 'list-of-skills'>
        <li></li>
      </ul>I have worked in many different settings including the medical industry, food & dining, automobile repair, tutoring, and, my current job, purchasing for a redistributor. I have a ton of experience working for and leading a team, from being a kitchen manager at Chipotle Mexican Grill to being a teammate in a human resource department for an occupational medical clinic. Deep down, I know my abilities are endless, and that's why I am taking my strengths to Lambda School.</p>
